    <h4>About Me ü¶ã</h4>
    <p>To start with, I'm Benson from Nakuru Kenya, currently at campus taking a course on computer science. Born on 1999 as a third born in a family of six - that includes my parents. I like to interact with computers and in general all electronic devices, so you can probably guess the kind of activities I do. I am a big fun of movies, documentaries and books.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bgdata">
    <h4>BACKGROUND DATA ü¶ã</h4>
    <p>In the past years, I have been working hard to look more about system desings, networking and algorithms. As a preparation for future expansion of coming technology complexity, I have done massive collection of resources to handle technology and coup with my living. I decided to chose programing as my career and working hard everyday to perfect myself in different projects.
    Read more about my career and much stuffs about programming on my portfolio here. üëâüèΩ ( <a href='https://krakinzlab.com'>krakinzlab</a> )</p>

    <div class="def"><h4>KIPPLE: DEFINATION ü¶ã</h4>
    <P>Kipple is all the useless stuff we collect over time that starts filing up our rooms, houses and eventually our lives. The term "KIPPLE" Was first introduced by science fiction author Terry Carr, but it became widely known with the release of Philip K. Dick's 1968 masterpiece Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?- the book that became the
    movie Blade Runner.
    The best explanation for what "kipple" is, can be found in a conversation between two of the characters in the book.</P>
    <div class="flex-box">
      <div class="begin"><p>Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers of yesterday's HOMEOPAPE. When nobody's
    around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more.</p></div>
    <div class="final">
    <p> 
      To the character J.R. Isadore, kipple was the enemy. To Philip K. Dick it was a symbol of entropy and consumerism -a clever allegory to illustrate how people are filling their lives with junk rather than substance. But is kipple really so bad?</p></div></div>
  </div>
    </section>
<div class="main"><h4>SHOW ME YOUR KIPPLE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE</h4>
  <p>To me, kipple is more than just a symbol of a consumer culture gone amok. If you think about it
  our kipple (or lack thereof) is a reflection of who we are. Look around you and notice all the
  useless stuff you surround yourself with, whether at home, at work or in your car in many ways all this stuff, your constantly growing pile of kipple, helps define you as a person diferent from other persons. <b>Your kipple is part of your identity; it defines you.</b></p>
  <h4>EVERY PIECE OF KIPPLE HAS A STORY</h4>
<p>When I look at all the kipple on my desk it's like leafing through a photo album. Every item has a story attached to it. It works as a memory anchor, keeping a constant reference to time and events long gone. Not all the stories are worth telling, but together they summarize and reference many of the important events of my life.
Without the kipple, the memories of these events would likely drift away into obscurity like leaves of paper on a stormy sea. So in an attempt to preserve some of my history for posterity and share with the world the virtues of kipple. I have created this web site where I will share with you some of my kipple and the stories they anchor to.</p>
